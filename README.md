## Description

This project uses counterfactual explanations to enhance interpretability for end-users. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of counterfactuals.


## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab:
   - [Google Colab Link] (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1p4EYu2FJc1wFixFSHVutyWlfyj7bLvHT?usp=sharing )

2. Run the cells in the notebook to generate counterfactual explanations and visualize results.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. You can access it [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset). It contains features related to credit scoring, which are used to generate and evaluate counterfactual explanations.


## Results

The generated counterfactual explanations provide insights into how changes in specific features affect credit scoring outcomes. Results are visualized in the notebook, demonstrating the effectiveness of the counterfactuals in improving model interpretability.
